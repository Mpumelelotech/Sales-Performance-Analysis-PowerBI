# Sales Performance Analysis using Power BI
### Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to uncover key trends and generate actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making.

### Specific Observations
Segment Performance:

The Corporate segment contributes the highest revenue (51.86%), despite the Consumer segment having the most orders.
This suggests opportunities to nurture corporate relationships while exploring upselling within the Consumer segment.

### Category & Regional Insights:

The Technology category generates the most revenue.
The South region has the highest average order value, suggesting it may be a good target for region-specific promotions.

### Target Analysis (2015):

Although sales and unit targets were exceeded, the orders target fell short.
This indicates a need to focus on boosting order frequency.

### Methodology
Conducted using Power BI, analyzing data across segments, regions, and product categories.
Focused on identifying revenue drivers and performance gaps against set targets.

### Key Findings
##### Segment:

Corporate leads in revenue.
Consumer leads in order volume.

Home Office shows low engagement.

##### Region:

West has the highest order volume.
South has the highest average order value.

##### Category:

Technology is the top-performing category.

##### 2015 Targets:

Sales and Units Sold exceeded targets.
Orders did not meet the target.

 ### Potential Next Steps
Explore ways to increase order value in the Consumer segment.

Investigate why the Home Office segment underperforms.

Analyze what drives high order value in the South region for possible application elsewhere.

Develop strategies to boost order frequency across all segments.
